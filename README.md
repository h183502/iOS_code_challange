# iOS_code_challange

Let me start by stating that this solution is far from what I would have liked it to be! But I hope that you can see what I have tried to accomplish...

I didn't exactly get the MVP architechture concept, so I decided to go for MVC as that is what I'm most comfortable with.

As far as consuming the API, I hava maneged to retrieve the comics and the title. Any other attribute from the API can easily be added if need be. I chose to add the title and comic strip for readability reasons.

The comics can be found by getting the latest strip, or by searching for a number. I unfortunately did not have enough time to implement the functionallity of searching with text :(


My main woe is alas the attempt to implement local persistance using CoreData. I have never used it before, and found it to be very very challanging, and did not manage to implement it successfully. I hope you can look at the code and see that I did try, and I hope and believe that I wasn't too far off. I would love to be able to explain what I tried to acheive.

Unfortunatly, tinkering with  this for too long  made it hard for me to explore the other requirements for the app. 

All though I'm not thrilled with the result, I did enjoy the challange a lot! Hopefully you can see something in the rough here :)

# iOS_code_challange


As far as consuming the API, I hava maneged to retrieve the comics and the title. Any other attribute from the API can easily be added if need be. I chose to add the title and comic strip for readability reasons.

The comics can be found by getting the latest strip, or by searching for a number. 

The functionallity of it being truly persistent is implemented but commented out. Need to delete the data stored by core data first.

After last time, one of the feedbacks, or questions, from you guys were why I chose to write the project using UIKit and not SwiftUI. That stuck with me so I have tried to familiarize myself with swiftUI, and I can clearly see the benifits over UIKit. I've spent some time trying to make this app using SwiftUI (as a separate project). Thats why I haven't made many changes to this repository. That means that I won't have much new functionalty to show, unfortunatly, but hopefully something to discuss in a potensial meeting.

I enjoyed the challange a lot! Hopefully you can see something in the rough here :)
